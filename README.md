# Help, I'm Hungry!

## Project Explained
The purpose of this project is to provide a front-end application which contains specific user stories and acceptance criteria as detailed below. Our team approached this project by first determining the open APIs available to us, then proceeded with the creative idea to build a recipe generator based on the food a person has on hand. This project solves the challenge of limited culinary resources on hand (a reality for these team members), and the need for encouragement while cooking (open the site and you will see)!


After completing this project, we had the following takeaways:
* deploy early and often
* fail fast
* wireframe first

## Success Criteria

### User Stories
```
AS A hungry user

```
GIVEN I am looking for a recipe to use what I have on hand
WHEN I enter the site
THEN I am first prompted for what ingredients I have available

WHEN prompted for using other pantry-type ingredients
THEN I am able to opt in or out

WHEN submitting my ingredients and pantry option
THEN I am returned a recipe that I can read which includes the ingredient(s) I have entered, all written to the page

WHEN returning the recipe chosen for me
THEN I also see a fun GIF graphic associated with one of the ingredients in my recipe
